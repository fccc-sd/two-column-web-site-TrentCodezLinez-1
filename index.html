    School and other stuff.
    </h3>
    <p>
    My home school is <strong>Liberty Center</strong>  and I was there ever since fourth grade.  
    My original school though is Delta, I quit because as "therapy" they locked me in a room.

    At Liberty I actually met my first <strong>REAL</strong> friend, Louis Colins. 
    Ever since we first met we've been best buds, me and him are like glue. 
    A while after i got into freshman year I got myself another <strong>REAL</strong> friend, his name is Logun Howard.

    <h3>General Info About Myself.</h3>
    <p>
        My full name is Trent Alaric Aparicio, but most people just call me Trent or Big T, depending on who you are.
        I have multiple hobbies but out of them my favorite is definitely building legos. 
        I have several disablities but they don't hold me back from the things I want to accomplish. 
        I have two favorite colors, blue and green, I am six foot and two inches tall, and I am sixteen years old.
